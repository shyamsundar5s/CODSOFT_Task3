# Spam SMS Detection
This project builds an AI model to classify SMS messages as **spam** or **legitimate (ham)** using natural language processing techniques.

## üß† Overview
We use text-based features and machine learning algorithms to automatically detect spam messages, helping reduce unwanted communication.

## üîç Techniques Used
* **Text Preprocessing** (cleaning, tokenization)
* **Feature Extraction**: TF-IDF, Word Embeddings
* **Models**:
  * Naive Bayes
  * Logistic Regression
  * Support Vector Machine (SVM)
